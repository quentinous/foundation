**Deep Review Complete - Change Plan**

**PRD Analysis:**
The PRD is currently in **Platinum State (100/100)**. It is fully specified, validated, and ready for architecture.
*   **Structure:** BMAD Standard (Complete).
*   **Quality:** High.

**Validation Findings:**
✅ **Zero Defects.** The previous validation report confirms all requirements are met.

**Your Edit Requirements:**
You requested to "improve and/or add features". Since the core is solid, I have identified **Feature Expansion** opportunities aligned with the "State-Resistant" mission.

**Proposed Change Plan (Feature Injection):**

I propose adding the following features to strengthen the value proposition:

**1. Add 'Warrant Canary' (Trust Feature) - Recommended**
*   **Action:** Add `FR23: Warrant Canary` and a new `Canary` page in Site Architecture.
*   **Description:** A cryptographically signed statement updated monthly confirming no government warrants/subpoenas have been received.
*   **Why:** Critical trust indicator for the "Cypherpunk" target audience.

**2. Accelerate 'Tuttle Network' (Early Access) - Recommended**
*   **Action:** Move from Phase 2 to Phase 1 (MVP) as an "Alpha Access" benefit for Hardware owners.
*   **Description:** "Tuttle Key" owners get exclusive access to the mesh messaging network alpha.
*   **Why:** drastically increases the perceived value of the hardware bundle.

**3. Advanced Obfuscation (V2Ray/Xray) - Recommended**
*   **Action:** Add `NFR14: Protocol Obfuscation`.
*   **Description:** Support V2Ray/Xray protocols alongside Wireguard.
*   **Why:** Wireguard is easily blocked by state firewalls (DPI); Obfuscation is required for true "State Resistance".

**Questions:**
1.  **Do you want to add all three (1, 2, 3)?**
2.  **Do you have another specific feature to add?**

**Please select which features to add (e.g., "All", "1 and 3", or describe your own).**
