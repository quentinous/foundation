# Critical Challenge: The "Sovereignty Theater" Accuse

**The Skeptic's Attack:**
> "You claim to offer 'State-Resistant' commerce, but you are shipping physical boxes via DHL/La Poste. These carriers require real names and addresses. Your 'No-IP Logging' is theater if the shipping label has my name on it. If a state actor wants to find a Tuttle Key owner, they just subpoena the carrier's records. Your entire 'Zero-Knowledge' premise collapses the moment a physical package leaves your warehouse."

**The Defense (Transparency & Mitigation):**

1.  **Acknowledge the Reality:** We cannot obscure the physical layer. We must admit this limitation openly in our Manifesto/Trust Center.
2.  **Mitigation 1: The "Shipping Proxy" (NFR15):** We strip *our* internal data. We can't control DHL, but we ensure *our* DB has no link.
3.  **Mitigation 2: Automated Purge (Data Redaction):** We actively purge shipping data 24h after delivery confirmation.
4.  **Mitigation 3: Drop-Points:** We should prioritize shipping to "Pickup Points" (Relais Colis) where ID checks are less stringent than home delivery surveillance, or allow "Poste Restante".

**Proposed PRD Adjustments (Transparency):**

1.  **Trust Page Update:** Add a "Threat Model" section to the Trust Center explicitly stating: *"We protect your digital identity, but physical shipping leaves a trail with carriers. Here is how we minimize it..."*
2.  **Feature Update:** Prioritize **Pickup Point / Locker Integration** (Mondial Relay, DHL Packstation) as the default shipping method over Home Delivery to minimize address exposure.

**Do you want to add these adjustments?**
